# Homework 22

1. Write class `MyStack`. Any class means that it encapsulates data and implementations for achieving a purpose. In this class it is supposed that you will encapsulate required data and implementations for the following methods

- `void push(int number)` -> places the number at the stack’s top
- `int pop()` -> returns a number from the stack’s top and removes it. In the case the stack is empty the method should throw exception NoSuchElementException
- `boolean isEmpty()` -> returns true if the stack is empty, otherwise false
- `int getMax()` -> returns maximal number in the stack. In the case the stack is empty the method should throw exception NoSuchElementException
- Requirement: All aforementioned methods should have implementation with complexity O[1]

1. Write functional tests for all methods of the class `MyStack`
